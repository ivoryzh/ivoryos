## Description
Granting SDLs flexibility and modularity makes it almost impossible to design a UI, yet it's a necessity for allowing more people to interact with it (democratisation). 
This web UI aims to ease up the control of any Python-based SDLs by displaying functions and parameters for initialized modules dynamically. 
The modules can be hardware API, high-level functions, or experiment workflow.
With the least modification of the current workflow, user can design, manage and execute their experimental designs and monitor the execution process. 

## System requirements
This software is developed and tested using Windows. This software and its dependencies are compatible across major platforms: Linux, macOS, and Windows. Some dependencies (Flask-SQLAlchemy) may require additional setup.

### Python Version
Python >=3.7 for best compatibility.
### Python dependencies
This software is compatible with the latest versions of all dependencies. 
- bcrypt~=4.0
- Flask-Login~=0.6
- Flask-Session~=0.8
- Flask-SocketIO~=5.3
- Flask-SQLAlchemy~=3.1
- SQLAlchemy-Utils~=0.41
- Flask-WTF~=1.2
- python-dotenv==1.0.1
- openai (optional ~=1.53)
- ax-platform (optional ~=0.3 or ~=0.4 for Python>=3.9)

## Installation
```bash
pip install ivoryos
```
or
```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/heingroup/ivoryos.git
cd ivoryos
pip install -e .
```

The installation may take 10 to 30 seconds to install. The installation time may vary and take up to several minutes, depending on the network speed, computer performance, and virtual environment settings.

## Instructions for use
### Quick start
In your SDL script, use `ivoryos(__name__)`. 
```python
import ivoryos

ivoryos.run(__name__)
```
### Login
Create an account and login (local database)
### Features
- **Direct control**: direct function calling _Device_ tab
- **Workflow design and iteration**:
  - **Design**: add function to canvas in _Design_ tab. click `Compile and Run` button to go to the execution page
  - **Execution**: configure iteration methods and parameters in _Compile/Run_ tab. 
  - **Database**: manage workflows in _Library_ tab.
- **Info page**: additional info in _About_ tab.


### Additional settings
#### AI assistant
To streamline the experimental design on SDLs, we also integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) to interpret the inspected functions and generate code according to task descriptions.

#### Enable LLMs with [OpenAI API](https://github.com/openai/openai-python)
1. Create a `.env` file for `OPENAI_API_KEY`
```
OPENAI_API_KEY="Your API Key"
```
2. In your SDL script, define model, you can use any GPT models.

```python
ivoryos.run(__name__, model="gpt-3.5-turbo")
```

#### Enable local LLMs with [Ollama](https://ollama.com/)
1. Download Ollama.
2. pull models from Ollama
3. In your SDL script, define LLM server and model, you can use any models available on Ollama.

```python
ivoryos.run(__name__, llm_server="localhost", model="llama3.1")
```

#### Add additional logger(s)
```python
ivoryos.run(__name__, logger="logger name")
```
or
```python
ivoryos.run(__name__, logger=["logger 1", "logger 2"])
```
#### Offline (design without hardware connection)
After one successful connection, a blueprint will be automatically saved and made accessible without hardware connection. In a new Python script in the same directory, use `ivoryos.run()` to start offline mode.

```python
ivoryos.run()
```
## Demo
In the [abstract_sdl.py](https://gitlab.com/heingroup/ivoryos/-/blob/main/example/sdl_example/abstract_sdl.py), where instances of `AbstractSDL` is created as `sdl`,
addresses will be available on terminal.
```Python
ivoryos.run(__name__)
```

 * Running on all addresses (0.0.0.0)
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:8000
 * Running on http://xxx.xx.xx.xxx:8000

### Directory structure

When you run the application for the first time, it will automatically create the following folders and files in the same directory:

- **`ivoryos_data/`**: Main directory for application-related data.
  - **`ivoryos_data/config_csv/`**: Contains iteration configuration files in CSV format.
  - **`ivoryos_data/llm_output/`**: Stores raw prompt generated for the large language model.
  - **`ivoryos_data/pseudo_deck/`**: Contains pseudo-deck `.pkl` files for offline access.
  - **`ivoryos_data/results/`**: Used for storing results or outputs during workflow execution.
  - **`ivoryos_data/scripts/`**: Holds Python scripts compiled from the visual programming script design.

- **`default.log`**: Log file that captures application logs.
- **`ivoryos.db`**: Database file that stores application data locally.
